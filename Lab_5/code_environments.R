# What is the hierarchy of environments?
# Global environment
names(.GlobalEnv)
# Environments of attached packages
# Environment of the base package
# Empty environment

# Related:
# attach: places names in the global environment
# load / library: doesnt'

# Environments hierarchy when using functions:
# Good reference: https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/278710_bb8897865caf43c6a39757278547b1f4.html
# the enclosing environment, the environment where the function was created
# binding a function to a name using <- creates a binding environment
# calling a function creates an execution environment that stores variable created during execution
# every execution environment is associated to a calling environment which tells you where the function was called

# The enclosing environment is the secret behind closures
power_again = function(exponent) {
    force(exponent)
    function(x) {
        x ^ exponent
    }
}
square_again = power_again(2)
square_again
environment(power_again)
environment(square_again)
# The same function can be binded to a different name for example in env_1,
# so it can have multiple binding environments


# Super assignment: <<-
# <<- doesn't create a variable in the current evironment, but modifies it inside a parent environment
# Now that env_1 and env_2 have parent environments, let's try it
z = 10
eval(expression(z <<- 1), envir = env_2)
z
names(env_2)
# If it doesn't find it there, it creates a variable in global environment

# Namespaces: as we've seen, what R finds as a value for a given name of a variable,
# depends on the hierarchy of environmets. To mitigate this, we use namespaces and ::
dplyr::count(data.frame(x = 1:10))
# This is especially important when writing packages
# Package environment: external interface - what we see (like above)
# Namespace environment: how functions in a package find their variables (including other functions, possibly from other packages)
# imports (namespace env) is the parent of the package env, global env is "the most parent" env here
# imports is the enclosing env
